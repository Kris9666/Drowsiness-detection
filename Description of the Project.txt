Drowsiness Detection :- Drowsiness Detection System is the software system that will alert the driver as soon as he fell asleep.

Approach steps- 

1. Open the camera.
2. Detect the face (Facial Regions)
3. Find both eyes co-ordinates.
4. Follow the eyebrows and if closed then alert. 


Challenges - 

1. How to know the eyebrows status (Open or Closed)/ Eye Aspect Ratio(EAR)?
   Since, we have the eyes position. We can follow as - 
 
	--> Calculate the distance between the upper and lower eyelids, and the corner of the eye
	--> Divide the distances
	--> Calculate the EAR for both eyes
	--> Divide the sum of the EARs by 2 to find the average EAR 


2. How to calculate the distance of the Eyelids/ EAR?
   
    EAR = ||p2-p6|| + ||p3-p5|| / 2||p1-p4||  i.e. we will find the Euclidean Distance.
		
    Euclidean Distance - It is the length of the line segment between two points in Euclidean space.
