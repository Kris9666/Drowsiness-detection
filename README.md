# Drowsiness-detection-system

This project is based on AI Computer Vision. The Drowsiness Detection System is an advanced safety feature designed to mitigate the risks associated with driver fatigue and drowsiness. The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and reliable system that can monitor the driver's state and alert them when signs of drowsiness are detected i.e. when the driver fell asleep. The system will employ cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision and machine learning to analyze facial expressions, eye movements, and other relevant indicators in real-time.
